# Hospital-Fever-Dashboard
---

### Project Overview
---

This repository presents a detailed analysis of a hospital fever diagnosis survey conducted on 1,000 participants, comprising 512 males and 488 females. 
The study aims to uncover patterns and factors associated with fever severity, leveraging data cleaned in Excel and visualized through Power BI dashboards. 
The findings can support healthcare professionals in identifying key contributors to fever severity and optimizing treatment plans.



### Dataset Details
---
The dataset includes the following fields:

* Temperature: Body temperature recorded during the survey
* Fever_Severity: Categorized severity levels of fever
* Age: Age of the participants
* Gender: Gender of the participants (Male/Female)
* BMI: Body Mass Index of the participants
* Headache: Presence or absence of headache
* Body_Ache: Presence or absence of body ache
* Fatigue: Presence or absence of fatigue
* Chronic_Conditions: Pre-existing chronic medical conditions
* Allergies: Presence of allergies
* Smoking_History: Smoking history of the participants
* Alcohol_Consumption: Frequency of alcohol consumption
* Humidity: Environmental humidity during the survey period
* AQI: Air Quality Index during the survey period
* Physical_Activity: Frequency and intensity of physical activity
* Diet_Type: Type of diet followed (e.g., vegetarian, non-vegetarian, etc.)
* Heart_Rate: Heart rate recorded during the survey
* Blood_Pressure: Blood pressure levels recorded
* Previous_Medication: Medications previously used by participants
* Recommended_Medication: Medications recommended based on diagnosis



### Data Cleaning and Transformation
---
The dataset was cleaned in Excel to ensure accuracy and uniformity. It was then transformed and visualized in Power BI, providing actionable insights into the patterns and factors influencing fever severity.



### Dashboards and Insights
---
The following Power BI dashboards were created to visualize and analyze the data:

* Gender Most Affected by Severe Fever
:Analyzes the distribution of severe fever cases by gender.

* Count of Diet Type by Age
:Visualizes the dietary preferences of participants segmented by age groups.

* Sum of BMI by Gender
:Displays the total BMI values for males and females, revealing gender-specific health trends.

* Count of Smoking History by Gender
:Tracks the smoking history of participants by gender, identifying lifestyle influences on health.

* Count of Fatigue by Age and Gender
:Explores fatigue levels segmented by age and gender, highlighting vulnerable demographics.

* Count of Chronic Conditions by Gender
:Shows the prevalence of chronic medical conditions among males and females.

* Alcohol Consumption by Gender
:Compares the frequency of alcohol consumption between genders.

* Previous Medications Used by Gender
:Analyzes the medications previously used by participants, segmented by gender.

* Average Temperature by Heart Rate
:Examines the relationship between body temperature and heart rate across participants.

* Recommended Medication by Gender
:Lists medications recommended for participants, categorized by gender.

* Count of Gender Splitting into Male and Female
:Provides a demographic breakdown of participants by gender.



### Tools Used
---
* Excel: Data cleaning and preparation
* Power BI: Data transformation, dashboard creation, and visualization



### Key Findings
---

* Severe fever was more prevalent in female.
* Participants with a sedentary lifestyle or poor diet types showed a higher severity of fever symptoms.
* Chronic conditions and smoking history were closely associated with increased fever severity.
* The average temperature showed significant variation with changes in heart rate, indicating potential links between fever and cardiovascular activity.

### Conclusion
---
This project offers a detailed examination of the factors contributing to fever severity, helping healthcare providers better understand patient demographics, lifestyle influences, and treatment efficacy. The insights from this analysis can guide preventive measures and improve patient outcomes.
